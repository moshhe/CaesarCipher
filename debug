/**
Code only works with capital letters, not lowercase
Try changing code in following ways:

- "currentChar = encrypted.charAt(i).toUpperCase;"
OR
- make String alphabet = "(A-Z and a-z)"
  - encrypted message's key may need to be changed to 52, but since the code will look only for the character's case, it will stay within the same case
